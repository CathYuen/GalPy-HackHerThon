Welcome to Virtual Mentor!
Virtual Mentor is your computer-sized, amicable study buddy. 
Just like a good friend would, Virtual Mentor invites you to recognise your feelings and suggests ways to enable you to work with, rather than against, your emotions to 
achieve your goals. 
Virtual Mentor begins by prompting you to select emotions which resonate with how you're feeling today out of a comprehensive list; from there, the app leads you to 
list the tasks you want to get done today and evaluate their urgency, importance and the time scale you have to complete these goals. 
With this information and an optimisation process based on the Eisenhower matrix, Virtual Mentor will suggest a plan for your day. 
If Virtual Mentor assesses that self-care time would benefit your wellbeing, they will suggest some activities catering to your individual needs.


Packages and plug-ins to download before beginning:
- Install 'PyQt5' using 'pip3 install pyqt5'
- Install 'simpleaudio' using 'pip install simpleaudio'
- Download all the modules and the music file in the same folder ('WelcomePage.py', 'Mood.py', 'Prioritisation.py', 'Result.py', and 'ThaiMeditation.wav')

Tips:
- Restart your kernel every time you close the Virtual Mentor
- Sometimes 'simpleaudio' won't work on Spyder (for Windows), so it may be best to switch to using a different Python IDE, such as IDLE
- Don't listen to the video with headphones!!


We hope you enjoy your Virtual Mentor! Thank you for the opportunity to have a chance to code a project like this :)
